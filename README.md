# Park Me

## Introduction
A smart vehicle parking system not only helps to look for parking but also saves time.
It is an integrated form of parking system which can help with organization of vehicle in a more efficient way.
The main problem with the existing parking system is that it cant tell how many slots are available for the parking in a parking space.
The Increasing population, leads to a greater number of private vehicles which drastically increases the number of parking space needed. So, a proper parking management system is needed.

## Optimizations
1. The graphical user interface needs to be improved.
2. A datebase should be used to store the data such as SQL or MongoDB or Firebase.
3. It needs a Admin Login and Size of slots so that admin can login and set the slots size.
4. The Show window should be for Admin only as it shows the Secret Token also.

Anyone Have Some Ideas or Advanced code you can Open a new Pull Request.

## Conclusion
1. This parking system can save time and you can book the parking earlier.
2. This can be used by every person who has a car or bike, and where there are a huge number of in and out of vehicles like Malls, Companies, Tourist Places you can book your parking earlier.
3. This new Parking system adds value to the modern day parking system.
